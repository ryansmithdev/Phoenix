			<p>The fastest way to install Phoenix is from our User-friendly website. Simply go here, and fill out the small form on the page. You will be asked for your existing hosting account address, and an FTP username and a password for that user. If you don't have an existing hosting account, Here are some hosting providers we like: HostGator, DreamHost, BlueHost. If you do have a hosting account already, this information can be retrieved from calling the provider's customer service.</p>
			<p>After you submit the form, you will be taken to your website. Follow the setup instructions there.</p>
			
			<h2>Developer Style</h2>
			
			<p>Before installation, please clear your hosting account root directory of all contents or anything that could conflict with Phoenix.</p>
			<p>Step 1: Download the .zip file here.</p>
			<p>Unzip the file, and place the contents into your root directory. There should be a .index.php file, and "Phoenix 1.x" directory.</p>
